Report Lab 3
Write your report in word file including:
  1. Report your hardware resources;
  2. Report computation performance on Windows and Linux (in table with capture image on running your program);
    - Generate a set of different input sizes (at least 3 inputs in size KBs up to MBs)
    - Execute your code and check the computation time on average 10 000 running times;
    - Summarize the results in a tables including: size of input, OS (Windows, Linux), encryption time and decryption time.
    - Do a comparison and your comments on both input size and OS;
